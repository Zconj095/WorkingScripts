def find_routes(source, destination, network_topology):
    """
    Finds possible routes from source to destination.

    This is a placeholder function. The actual implementation should consider
    dynamic routing based on ANN decisions which will be integrated later.

    Parameters:
    - source: int, the source node
    - destination: int, the destination node
    - network_topology: numpy array, the network topology

    Returns:
    - List of routes (as lists of node indices)

    else:
        return []  # No route found

# Example usage
